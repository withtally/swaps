Quote Management: Provides functionality to get quotes for swaps, including details like sell and buy tokens, amounts, and fees.

Native Price Retrieval: Offers the ability to fetch the native price of a token within the Ethereum blockchain.

Order Management: Enables querying of orders based on a specific Ethereum chain ID and user address.
